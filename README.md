## ðŸ•’Digilog Clock : A Fun Web Project Made with ChatGPT

The Time Digit Clock is a creative and interactive analog-style clock built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Unlike traditional clocks, it displays the current time using animated digits positioned around the dial, where the hour, minute and second values move dynamically every second.

**The interface includes:**

* A circular clock face styled with a glowing border.
* Hour and minute tick marks properly aligned and facing toward the center, replicating the look of a real analog clock
* Numbers (1 to 12) placed precisely at 30Â° intervals, aligned with the longer hour ticks
* Moving colored time digits (hour in turquoise, minute in light green, second in red), forming radial lines
* A clean and modern dark theme layout

This project was developed as a fun experiment to explore DOM manipulation, trigonometric positioning, and dynamic rendering in JavaScript.
